\title{Disjunct core area density of the whole landscape(vector data)}
\usage{
vm_l_dcad(landscape, edge_depth)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{the input landscape image,}

\item{edge_depth}{the fixed distance to the edge of the patch}
}
\value{
the returned calculated ratios are in column "value",
and this function returns also some important information such as level and metric name,
Moreover, class number and the "id" column, although both are "NA" here in the landscape level
}
\description{
This function allows you to calculate the number of disjunct core areas
in relation to the landscape area in a categorical landscape in vector data format
}
\examples{
vm_l_dcad(vector_landscape, edge_depth = 1)
}
