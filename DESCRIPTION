Description: Calculates landscape and shape metrics for categorical landscape patterns described as vector layers, in 
    a tidy, piped workflow. 'vectormetrics' reimplements the most common landscapemetrics from 'FRAGSTATS' (<https://www.fragstats.org/>)
    and 'landscapemetrics' (<https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/>) and adds many new metrics related to the shape of polygons.
    It also provides utility functions to break multipolygon patches and calculate main axes of the shapes.
